Step 1:
SELECT SeqVal
  FROM NumSeq AS A
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                     FROM NumSeq AS B
                    WHERE B.SeqVal = A.SeqVal + 1
                  )

Step 2:
SELECT SeqVal + 1 AS '开始间隔'
  FROM NumSeq AS A
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                     FROM NumSeq AS B
                    WHERE B.SeqVal = A.SeqVal + 1
                  )
   AND SeqVal < (SELECT MAX(SeqVal)
                   FROM NumSeq
                )

Step 3:
SELECT SeqVal + 1 AS '开始间隔',
       (SELECT MIN(C.SeqVal)
          FROM NumSeq AS C
         WHERE C.SeqVal > A.SeqVal
       ) - 1 AS '结束间隔'
  FROM NumSeq AS A
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT *
                     FROM NumSeq AS B
                    WHERE B.SeqVal = A.SeqVal +1
                  )
   AND SeqVal < (SELECT MAX(SeqVal)
                   FROM NumSeq
                )
